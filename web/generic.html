						<h3>Some Changes in the Climate System and the Impacts of Them</h3>
						<p>It gives damage in lots of ways such as some changes in the hydrological cycle, melting of the icebergs, warming oceans, rising sea levels, unexpected and extreme weather conditions. These changings have significant impacts on climate change. Some of them are decreasing water supplies, fisheries failing, heat stress, decreasing of food supplies, loss of biodiversity, damage to the forests and the animals which are living in them. </p>

								<h3>Climate Change's Impacts on the Weather and Oceans</h3>
								<p>According to research, since the industrial revolution, average global temperatures have risen by more than 1Â°C after the 1850s every year. Heatwaves have been the most dangerous worldwide weather. Therefore, water heats up too. After water gets heat, it is taking extra water from melting ice. That causes rises in the water.</p>
